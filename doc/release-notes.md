# WAGERR Core version 4.0.0

Release is now available from:

  <https://github.com/wagerr/wagerr/releases>

This is a new major version release, bringing major performance and stability improvements, new
features, various bugfixes and other improvements.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/wagerr/wagerr/issues>


## Upgrading and downgrading

### Recommended upgrade

### How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Wagerr-Qt (on Mac) or
wagerr/wagerr-qt (on Linux). If you were using version < 4.0.0 you will have to reindex
(start with -reindex) or resync (start with -resync) to make sure your wallet has all
the new data synced.

## Downgrade warning

### Downgrade to a version < 3.0.0

Downgrading to a version smaller than 3.0 is not supported anymore as the Wagerr Betting
Protocol V3 activated on mainnet and testnet.

### Downgrade to versions 3.0.0 - 3.1.0

Downgrading to 3.0 and 3.1 releases is fully supported but is highly discouraged unless
you have some serious issues with version 4.0.

### Compatibility

WAGERR Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). WAGERR Core software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

WAGERR Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

## Notable changes

4.0 introduces a fully rewritten database layer for the processing of betting activities. As a result:
- All betting activities are handled by the core client's (cached) internal database.
- Transaction and block processing is significantly faster. Block synchronization now averages at 7 hours for a full sync.
- Improved stability due to better handlign of chain reorganizations, fixing instability issues in the 3.x clients.
- All betting data from the Wagerr blockchain are made available through the core client now, including placed bets,
  bet result statuses, odds, spread amounts, total amounts, and score outcome of matches.
- New commands include: getmybets, getbetbytxid "txid", getpayoutinfo "txid".
